# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This repository contains a Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The program allows users to encrypt and decrypt text messages by specifying a shift value.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypt a message by shifting its characters by a specified value.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt a message that was previously encrypted using the Caesar Cipher by using the same shift value.
- **User Interaction**: The program provides a simple text-based menu for users to choose between encryption, decryption, and exiting the program.


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Installation

 Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher.git
